# Heart Disease Prediction
Here we tried to create a prediction model based on the data of Heart Disease Cleveland UCI (https://www.kaggle.com/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)
Based on the predictors listed in the Dataset, different prediction methods have been applied to predict the presence of heart disease for each individual under study. Exploratory Data Analysis and  Statistical analysis have been performed at the beginning of the study to get information about the dataset.
Different methods have been used: LDA model, KNN3, KNN6, Logistic regression, Tree and Ramdom forest. In the end, the prediction methods are compared based on their accuracy.
