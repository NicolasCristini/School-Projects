# Mystery Coffee
The idea of the “Mystery Coffee” (aka “Coffee Partner Lottery”) is to randomly assign people to each
other for a coffee meeting to facilitate informal virtual interactions among colleagues while
working from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
This program randomly matches all the partecipants in pairs/group, send an e-mail to each partecipant with a random joke to start the discussion. 

It works in this way:
1. To partecipate at the event, you need to scan the QR code and insert your information.
2. An excel file will be produced with all the information of the partecipants (name, mail, country)
3. The excel file must be manually saved as .csv file in the code folder
4. By running the main.py each partecipant will be assigned to a group, a joke will be rqested from the web (https://conversationstartersworld.com/random-question-generator/), an e-mail will be sent to each partecipant to notify in which group they have been assigned.

--- To improve this program. It would be nice to send with the mail text a LINK to partecipate at the programmed meeting on a online platform ---
